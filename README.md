Medium post using Kickstarter dataset

Kickstarter campaigns can make ideas into reality. We want to explore if we can categorize a kickstart project into different classes by using its goals or name. In other words, we want to answer the following questions:
- How do projects from different categories differ? Is there any category which has higher goals on average? Or longer crowdfunding duration?
- Can we classify projects based only on their goals specifications (duration, year, value)?
- Can we classify projects based only on their titles?
